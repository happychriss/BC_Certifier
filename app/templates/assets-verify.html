                    <p>As a validator (e.g. employee) you get the certificate as PDF to check if it was issued by the Certifier.</p>
                    <p>When pressing "CHECK" the Hash of the file will be calculated. The Javascript on this page will than read the Smart Contract to find a matching Hash.</p>
                    <p>As a final step you need to double-check that the Public-Address belongs to the Certifier, e.g. by checking the Certifier WebPage.</p>
